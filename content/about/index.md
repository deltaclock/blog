Hello! I'm **Nikolaos Mourousias**, a Security Researcher with extensive specialization in **Web** and **Mobile** security. I often leverage my skills in reverse engineering and binary exploitation techniques to delve deeper into more complex security vulnerabilities.

This blog is my space to explore niche security topics, revisit foundational techniques with a modern lens, and share my findings. You'll also find a collection of my published research, security advisories, and CTF write-ups here.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with anything IT-related and, of course, playing CTFs with my team, [Zer0Tolerance](https://x.com/0tolerance_ctf).

You can contact me at deltaclock [@] protonmail.com
